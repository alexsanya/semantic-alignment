  "I would like to build some animations for my video. The animation should demonstrate the process of semantic alignment of two texts - it starts from 2 pieces of paper and then shown how they are \"zipped\" chunk-by-chunk. What tools would you advice me to use for generation this animation?",
  "Write a code using manim that will render a scene: - Two rectangles of the same size with same aspect ratio as A4 are located in left and right corners of a screen. There is \"T\" letter in the top left corner of each rectangle. In the center of left rectangle there is a lable \"RU\", at the center of right rectangle there is a label \"ES\" - Both rectangles are divided into 7 horizontal bars from top to the bottom - Bars starting moving towards the center of scene one-by-one - zipping into new rectangle and stacking on top of each other - The scene stops when stacking is finished - we have rectangle in the middle formed from bars",
  "Keep the original color for each chunk. Add transition showing the chunk moving towards the center. Make sure that rectangle in center have 10 chunks in total - 5 from left and 5 from right",
  "Add OpenAI logo on top of the middle rectangle",
  "Rewrite merging into center - rectangles just needs to be stacked from top to bottom - the first on the top ten the next right above and so on...",
  "Yes, they should alternate. Add text inside each bar - ru for chunks those came from left and es for chunks those came from right",
  "Let's change animation. Now don't split the right rectangle from the beginning - keep it integral. Once the chunk from left side took it place: - choose random with for right chunk (within 50% margin) - slice right chunk form right rectangle and place it at the bottom of middle rectangle - repeat until chunks are placed to the middle",
  "Just one remark - the height should be chosen randomly, keep width the same for all rectangles",
  "Always slice the chunk from the top of right rectangle",
  "Reduce the scale of each chunk by 40% while it moves towards the center - so in the result the stack of chunks will look the same just 40% smaller",
  "Show lables in the center of each chunk only once the chunk is already moved to the middle",
  "Make the labels on each chunk black instead of white",
  "Any idea why I see white lables on top of each chunk but don't see black?",
  "After each chunk is leaving right rectangle draw a mark line - border bottom - to mark it's height in right rectangle",
  "Make sure that the sum of right chunks is equal to the height of right rectangle",
  "Make right rectangle to be filled with green color - but once chunks are leaving from top to the bottom the empty space have to be black",
  "Check z-index of black overlay - I still see the green color for the whole rectangle even when chunks are removed",
  "Let's do it a different way - instead of ground black overlay from top to the bottom place a black chunk of equal size on top of right rectangle in same exact place from where the green chunk just left",
  "Make sure T and ES labels stays on top of black overlay of right rectangle",
  "At the beginning of scene place 2 pictures \"coverRu.png\" and \"coverEs.png\" on top of left and right rectangles. Then make them fade away before the chunks movement begins",
  "Add picture from \"openAi_logo.png\" above the rectangle in the middle - place it at the very beginning of scene",
  "Move \"openAi_logo.png\" above to avoid it's intersection with middle rectangle"
